## Quick Start Guide

### For Beginners:
1. Start with `examples/basic/simple_test.py` for basic functionality
2. Progress to `examples/basic/fixed_demo.py` for comprehensive features
3. Explore `examples/realistic/` for practical examples

### For Advanced Users:
1. Review `examples/advanced/` for agent-based automation
2. Study `examples/intervention/` for error handling patterns
3. Implement production workflows from `examples/automation/`

### For Production Deployment:
1. Use `examples/automation/business_workflow_demo.py` as a template
2. Adapt `examples/realistic/` examples to your use cases
3. Implement human intervention from `examples/intervention/`
